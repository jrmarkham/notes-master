Notes: Front End Development Challenge
========================================

Greetings, thanks for your interest in joining the team here at PCH. Part of our
evaluation process is to set an open-ended challenge which will allow you to
flex your creative muscles and give you an opportunity to demonstrate your
coding skills. We think (and hope you agree) that this is better than asking
you to scribble algorithms on a whiteboard in an interview setting.

We realize that this represents a significant investment of effort, but we
hope it will be worthwhile for both you and us.

If you are successful then we'll invite you to our offices for a face-to-face
interview and will use what you produce for this challenge as a starting
point for our chat.

Good Luck!  
The PCH UI Team


Overview
--------

We would like you to create a **note taking application** to the best of your abaility.
1. this application should allow you to make multiple note-sheets that maintain their own data
2. you can have 0 to many note-sheets
3. the ability to color the note-sheets background color
4. edit the note-sheets after creation

# extra credit
1. note-sheets maintain their state after the browser has been refreshed
2. note-sheets are draggable
3. you can resize a note-sheet


Design Guide
------------

Please see **notes.png** for reference, but not as a strict design guideline.


Installation
------------

Clone the project

```
git clone https://git.prod.pch.com/agileui/interviews/notes.git
```


Evaluation
----------

Our goal is to find answers to these questions:

* Do you understand the JavaScript language in particular ES6 as well as general web technologies?
* Do you understand SASS or other CSS preprocessors?
* Can you design interfaces that are clear and easy to use?
* Can you use GIT or other source control applications?
* Do you understand NPM and know how to use it?
* How closely can you follow creative assets? ( see notes.png )
* How do you optimize this project in code and graphic assets?


Due to the limited time consider the followings:

* It is **important** you try to complete all the objectives but, it is better to have a functional project that doesn't meet all requirements than a non-functional project.
* You can develop just for the latest version of Chrome and Firefox.


Delivery
--------

We expect to receive a **zip** of all working files and your project should be runnable.# notes-master
